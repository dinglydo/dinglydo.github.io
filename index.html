		<h2>About DinglyDo</h2>
		<p>DinglyDo likes math, he also likes computers. So he had the idea of merging the two together! Although everything he says has already been known for more than a century, not everybody has the time or patience to read through all these articles to fulfill their curiousity. And so, I decided that I could make a fine job compiling all these resources for you -- while also adding my own flavor to the mix. So far I've only written about math, however expect other articles dealing with other subjects as I like to branch out a bit sometimes. <strong>Note: Anything that is blue and underlined is clickable (And probably does something).</strong></p>
